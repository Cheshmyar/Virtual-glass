# Virtual-glass
My journey on developing a virtual glass model

Media_pipe prototype is armed with google's "media_pipe" face detector.

Compared to "harcascade" model is a lot more efficient, lighter, more accurate and therefore is a better option.

 Due to deficit of helps and documents for google's mediapipe it took a lot of time to figure out how to use the detected features for virtual try-on glasses (so google, if you're watching this, you made it look impossible at first)
 
 Since it's the first virtual try-on model that is using medipipe, please acknowledge my efforts and help this to be seen.
 
 There are 10 pictures of sunglasses that they are totally real. also, there were modifications on the pictures of sunglasses including eradication of temples and temple tips.
 
 Inside the code named "mediapipe_realtime.py" there is a comprehensive guide on what I have done and why.
 I would appreciate sharing, starring, forking this.
 
 The model was built on 2022 March 6th, applying further modifications upon the first prototype, now as of 2022 March 16th it's final.

A video on how well the model performs will be posted on my linkedin:
